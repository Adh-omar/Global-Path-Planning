# Global-Path-Planning
This is the software developed by me (Adh-omar) for the TBReAI autonomous formula student racecar. While some parts of the code have made into the final product. This repository is more of a demonstration of what I accomplished in developing that software.


This repository is the global path planning section developed for the TBReAI team at the University of Bath in 2020.
We were set to compete in July, however the competition was cancelled due to COVID-19.

The code in this repository is not meant to be functional. But rather, it is a demonstration of the various methods
employed to achieve the self-driving behaviour desired in the racecar.

The two algorithms that made into the final product are the shortest distance algorithm,
and the Elessawy Corner Handling Optimization (ECHO) algorithm.
